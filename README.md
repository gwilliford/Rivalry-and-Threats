# Decline And Retrenchment Replication Data
Contains Stata code and data to replicate analyses in: Atkinson, Douglas B. Joshua L. Jackson, and George W. Williford. 2020. ​Rivalry, Uncertainty, and Militarized Compellent Threats. Journal of Global Security Studies. Available online now.

## Project Description
Rivalry scholars have done much to explain how rivalries begin and how they end, but much less attention had been paid to when states will choose to engage in militarized behavior that ultimately continues the rivalry. Uncertainty concerning the ability of an opponent’s willingness to continue to pay the costs associated with the rivalry periodically surface, and states eliminate this uncertainty by issuing threats designed to compel the enemy to make concessions on the underlying issue. States issue threats to signal their commitment to continue disputing the issue, or to force their opponent to reveal their ability to bear the costs of the dispute. We test our arguments across a large-n dataset and find support for our hypotheses.
